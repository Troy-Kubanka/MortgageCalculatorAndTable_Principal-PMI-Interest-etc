# MortgageCalculatorAndTable_Principal-PMI-Interest-etc

This is a mortgage calculator and planner project that I created in C++.

The program outputs a chart of their month-to-month payments until the house is paid off. 
Each row includes that month's PMI (if applicable), monthly payment, amount remaining to pay off,
