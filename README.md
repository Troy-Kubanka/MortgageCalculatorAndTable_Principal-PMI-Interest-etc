# MortgageCalculatorAndTable_Principal-PMI-Interest-etc

This is part of a mortgage calculator and planner project that I created in C++ to be used for local home buyers. 
The buyer inputs the house's sale price, their down payment %, and their interest rate.
The program outputs an amortization table chart of their month-to-month payments until the house is paid off. 
Each row includes that month's interest payment, principal payment, principal balance, and PMI (if applicable).
